# Machine Learning Exploration

During this capstione project, we did several Exploration in order to get the best result of the application. Several noted Exploration that we did are:


### GPT-Langchain Chatbot API

We has tried to insert GPT model to our Chatbot. The API was customized so the output will give links from the Internet based on user input. So, this chatbot will give three outputs:
1. Main Answer (GPT-Langchain)
2. Links related to the question (GPT-Langchain)
3. Dicoding's Discussion related to the question (Cosine Similarity from Tensorflow)

### GPT-Langchain Chatbot Application

We also use Express.JS to consume the API so this prototype is ready to use.
